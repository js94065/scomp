Here are some preliminary steps for getting started.

  #1 Get IRC (if you don't have it).  It is very simple.  The client I use is mIRC, but there are a lot of other free ones out there.  Let me know when you have IRC set up or if you run into any problems.  I am also open to other forms of communication (AIM, gtalk, skype).  I'll probably leave IRC open for the next few days so you can find me. <br> <br> IRC meeting place: server: chat.freenode.net (port 6667), channel: scompiler <br> Download mIRC: http://www.mirc.com/ <br> <br>
  # Get a Google account (if you don't already have one) and tell me your screen name so I can add you to the project.  The project will be hosted on Google Code since the interface looks cleaner than sourceforge.  Google Code requires all developers to have a google account.  If this is not possible, or if people would prefer to use sourceforge, let me know. <br> <br> Google Account: https://www.google.com/accounts/ <br> <br>
  # My original idea was to just do the assignments from the MIT compilers class from opencourseware.  This is available at the link below.  We can also follow a book or other online resources. <br> <br> MIT opencourseware: http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-035Fall-2005/CourseHome/index.htm. <br> <br>
  # If you have suggestions for other things we can do then let me know.  

The most important thing is to set up IRC for faster communication.

= Work Tools = 

  * Project Files: http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-035Fall-2005/Projects/index.htm 
  * Language our compiler compiles: Decaf (described in project files above)
  * Development Language: Java
  * Forum: See Wiki tab from above
  * Tasks: See Issues tab from above
  * Source: See Source tab above, we are using SVN: https://scomp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scomp/
  * IDE: Eclipse
  * Scanner generator: JLex
  * Parser generator: CUP

= Conventions =

  * All file and folder names should be in lowercase, except Java class files which should be in "UpperCamelCase".
  * All text files should be encoded in UTF-8 (check your Eclipse preferences)
