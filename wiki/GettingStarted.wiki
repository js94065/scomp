= Intro = 

Here are some preliminary steps for getting started.

  #1 Get IRC (if you don't have it).  It is very simple.  One suggested client is mIRC, but there are a lot of other free ones out there.  We can also try other forms of communication (AIM, gtalk, skype).  <br><br> IRC meeting place: server: chat.freenode.net (port 6667), channel: #scompiler <br> Download mIRC: http://www.mirc.com/ <br> <br>
  # Get a Google account (if you don't already have one) and ask js94065 to add your screen name to the project.  The project will be hosted on Google Code since the interface looks cleaner than sourceforge.  Google Code requires all developers to have a google account.  <br><br> Google Account: https://www.google.com/accounts/ <br> <br>
  # For this project, we will be following the assignments from the MIT compilers class from opencourseware.  This is available at the link below.  We can also follow a book or other online resources. <br><br> MIT opencourseware: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-035-computer-language-engineering-sma-5502-fall-2005/ <br> <br>

= Work Tools = 

  * Project Files: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-035-computer-language-engineering-sma-5502-fall-2005/projects/
  * Language our compiler compiles: Decaf (described in project files above)
  * Development Language: Java
  * Tasks: See Issues tab from above
  * Wiki: See Wiki tab from above
  * Source: See Source tab above, we are using SVN: https://scomp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scomp/
  * IDE: Eclipse
  * Scanner generator: JLex
  * Parser generator: CUP
  * Forum: http://groups.google.com/group/scompiler.  

= Conventions =

  * All file and folder names should be in lowercase, except Java class files which should be in UpperCamelCase
  * All text files should be encoded in UTF-8 (check your Eclipse preferences)
