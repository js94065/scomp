=# Intro = 

Here are some preliminary steps for getting started.

  
  # Get a Google account (if you don't already have one) and ask js94065 to add your screen name to the project.  The project will be hosted on Google Code since the interface looks cleaner than sourceforge.  Google Code requires all developers to have a google account.  <br><br> Google Account: https://www.google.com/accounts/ <br> <br>
  # We will use gtalk for instant messaging.  We will hold meetings using partychat: http://partychapp.appspot.com/.  To use partychat, just add: scompiler@partychapp.appspotchat.com to your gtalk buddy list and open a conversation window with this person to join the chatroom.  
  # For this project, we will be following the assignments from the MIT compilers class from opencourseware.  This is available at the link below.  We can also follow a book or other online resources. <br><br> MIT opencourseware: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-035-computer-language-engineering-sma-5502-fall-2005/ <br> <br>
  # One of the original communications plans was to use IRC, but we later decided partychat was bad.  Here's the old info for reference.  <br><br> IRC meeting place: server: chat.freenode.net (port 6667), channel: scompiler
